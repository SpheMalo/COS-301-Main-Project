\subsection{Project scope}

\section{Application requirements and design}
\par{This section discusses for each module of the Figbook system the functional requirements
as well as the process designs for the use cases and the domain models which must be maintained
within persistent storage by that module.

\subsection{Authentication}

\subsubsection{scope}
\par{This section provides the details use case requirements for the use cases offered by the Authentication
module.}

\subsubsection{use cases}

\begin{enumerate}


\item \textbf{registerAccount  – priority: important } 
This use case creates  a user account and is persisted through to database.

\item \textbf{deleteAccount  – priority: important} 
This use case creates  a user account and is persisted through to database.

\item \textbf{SuspendAccount - priority: important}\\
This use case allows the system administrator to suspend a users account for any reason he/she may see as appropriate. A suspended account bars the user from logging in and/or using the account until the administrator lifts the suspension.
\\ \textbf{service contract:} The service contract for the suspendAccount service is shown below.
