\section{Project Execution}
\par{A release will be delivered to the client on a frequent basis, and so the clientsâ€™ availability is very crucial during the development phase. This is done to keep us (the developers) and the client on the same wavelength, with regards to the scope and changes to requirements and this also encourages progress. 
}
\\
\par{The team will work together most of the time, at times separately depending on the work load and how work is divided. The project is web-based and so HTML for obvious reasons will be used, together with the other technologies e.g. mongoDB, javascript, ajax, nodeunit and others depending on the development process.
}
\\
\par{We promise fully functional working system, a better system than the one initially requested. The client will be happy and welcoming to the system, as they were involved throughout the development process.
