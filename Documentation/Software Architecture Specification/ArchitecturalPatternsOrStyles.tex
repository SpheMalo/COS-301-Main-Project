	\subsection{Three-tier Architecture}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reasons for using:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Is to allow any of the three tiers to be upgraded or replaced independently, when changes in requirements or technology require such upgrades or replacements. Thus addressing \textbf{maintainability}.
					\item It is an applicable solution for web development. Where the three tiers are divided up into: \begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Presentation-tier:} Which will be the front-end of the website.
		\item \textbf{Application-tier:} This is the logical tier which provides the application's functionality.	
		\item \textbf{Data tier:} All the data persistence mechanisms which will be used.
