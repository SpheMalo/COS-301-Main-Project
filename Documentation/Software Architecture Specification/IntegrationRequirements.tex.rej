-\subsubsection{Channels}
+
+\textbf{Introduction}\paragraph{This section will cover the integration channels between the different systems that will eventually make up a working Figbook system.
+Access channels will also be discussed, these are the different channels to access the system together with the APIs used to provide this access. } 
+
+\subsubsection{Integration Channels}
 \begin{itemize}
-\item REST: Representational State Transfer
+\item Mediawiki - An open source wiki package to be used in Figbook
 \begin{itemize}
-\item The REST architecture design is a good option to use as it is a simpler than SOAP and is a dynamic design.
-\item A RESTul system can integrate well with HTTP as RESTful systems are optimized for the web.
-\item Restful systems needs to follow a client-server model,so this means that there needs to be communication between the client and server which is vital in the buzz system.
-\item There is support for a lot of components to interact with each other and to be interchangeable.
+\item The Mediawiki package will be used as an API within the Figbook project, it will provide collabrative writing previllages that are the core of Figbook.
+\item The Mediawiki database will be integrated with the Figbook database (both mysql) for uniform persistance.
+\item This package will also provide other services like communication, reporting and Authentication.
+\item Using Mediawiki as an API will mean that it will be contained within the system reducing dependencies on external systems.
 \end{itemize}
+\item Bluemix Single Sign On - This service will be used as nice to have for the authentication module, to allow users to sign into the system using external LDAP directories.
+\item SOAP (Simple Access Project Protocol) allows programs that run on different operating system to communicate using HTTP and XML. It is platform and language independent, It is useful in handling asynchronous processing and it supports many protocols and technologies.
 \end{itemize}
-\subsubsection{Protocols}
+\subsubsection{Access channels}
 \begin{itemize}
-\item Http(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the main protocol for all websites in the modern internet usage.It allows linking of nodes which allows the users to easily navigate through web pages.
-\item HTTPS is a more secure version of Http.HTTPS is a combination of HTTP and TSL and SSH.This protocol will ensure that data is safely transported.
-\item TCP/IP(Transfer Communication Protocol/Internet Protocal) Used to as communication over the internet.TCP is reliable and is able to check for errors in the transfer of the page over the IP.
-\item SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to send emails.This will be easier then mailing manually and is prominently used in the web space.
-\item IPv6(Internet Protocol version 6) This will  redirected and to allow them to be redirect users or routed to the correct space on the internet.This provides access to buzz through the use of http and the TCP/IP protocols.
-\item IPsec(Internet Protocol Security) will allow for a secure IP and to ensure no harmful data is ever transmitted to the servers of buzz.
+\item Figbook will be accessible via a web interface that is bootstraped to cater for all devices with browers.
+\item Figbook should be accessible in the future via a Desktop interface as well as a mobile application (not in scope of the project).
+\item Access to figbook is provided via the https protocol to ensure security.
+\item IPsec(Internet Protocol Security) will allow for a secure IP and to ensure no harmful data is ever transmitted to the servers of figbook.
 \end{itemize}
 
-\subsubsection{API Specifications}
+\subsubsection{API Specifications used for integration and access}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Web Service Definition Language(WSDL) - WSDL will be used to describe the functionality and the operations provided by the web-based service (Buzz system).
-\item Common Object Request Broker Architecture(CORBA) - CORBA will mediate the communication between the diverse systems that will be integrated to the Buzz system to provide added functionality and data for the operation of the system.
-\item Interactive Data Language(IDL) - This will be used for data analysis purposes for the data passed from the data source to the Buzz system and any other form of data required by the system.
+\item Interactive Data Language(IDL) - This will be used for data handling purposes for the data source integration for Mediawiki and figbook and any other form of data required by the system.
+\item Php - Mysql APIs will be used to query the database.
+\item Mediawiki uses a RESTful web services API that allows users to access the services without knowledge of the inner system. 
 \end{itemize}
