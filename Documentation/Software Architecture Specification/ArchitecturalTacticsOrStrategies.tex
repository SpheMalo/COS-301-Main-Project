\section{Architectural Tactics/Strategies}

\subsection{Security}
\par{\textbf{Authentication} - Achieved via the Authentication module of the website. Users need to log in with a valid username and password before they can use any functionality of the website. \\\textbf{Encryption} - Sensitive information like user passwords, content of the books etc is encrypted in the database instead of being stored in plain text. }

\subsection{Scalability}

\subsection{Integrability}

\subsection{Usability}
\par{\textbf{Naming Convention} - Buttons and information on the website are labeled with functional names. Whatever a section/button/link does, is what it's called (avoided "Click Me" or "Click Here" type of labels). \\\textbf{Logical Flow of Page Elements} - The webpages follow a human natural flow with its content (beginning of elements on the left, anything that follows from there goes in a right-down direction). }
