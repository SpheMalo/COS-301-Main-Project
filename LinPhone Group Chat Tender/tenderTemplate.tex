\section{Project Execution}

\subsection{Development Methodology}
As specified by the client, we will use the Waterfall development methodology for this project. This entails building the project in different phases, beginning with functional and architectural requirements, moving on to implementation and ending with testing.

\subsection{Contact Time}
Since we're not using agile development (which would require much more contact time with the client), we would need to meet with the client every two weeks or at least at the end of every development phase. These times are of course negotiable with the client.
