\section{Project Execution}

\subsection{Development Methodology}
\par{As specified by the client, we will use the Waterfall development methodology for this project. This entails building the project in different phases, beginning with functional and architectural requirements, moving on to implementation and ending with testing.}

\subsection{Contact Time}
\par{Since we're not using agile development (which would require much more contact time with the client), we would need to meet with the client every two weeks or at least at the end of every development phase. These times are of course negotiable with the client.}

\subsection{Initial ideas}
\par{We plan to make the system comply to 3 quality requirements, namely \textbf{Usability}, \textbf{Security} and \textbf{scalability}. It is important for the system to be easy to use. We aim to design and implement it using Human-Computer Interaction techniques that will allow users to recall how to use the system after initial use, as opposed to reading instructions on how to use the system. \newline The cryptography will ensure the security aspect. Since users will be exchanging potentially important/private information in their messages it is crucial that they know their communication is safe. \newline Finally, the system should be scalable. It is important that the system be able to handle the number of users that use the system, as well as accomodate for growth in numbers. \newline We feel these 3 requirements are core to this system and are crucial to the success of the project. Therefore we will work tirelessly to ensure these qualities hold for the system.}

\subsection{Technologies to be used}
\par{The client has been quite explicit in detailing the technologies required for this project. We would just like to add that we're comfortable using Java and C/++ as well as Eclipse (on either Windows or Linux systems). We'll also continue using any technologies the current system already uses, or (if we feel necessary) recommend changes to the client in due time.}

\subsection{Deliverables}
\paragraph{All deliverables will comply with those requested in the client specification, namely:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Source code and build instructions.
\item DO-178 deliverables as specified by the supplied Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC) and Software Development Plan (SDP).
\item A demonstration of developed features.
\item A pull request to the Linphone maintainer for the inclusion of the developed code into the Linphone project.
\end{itemize}
